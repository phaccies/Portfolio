# Personal Portfolio

This is my personal portfolio that was developed using React and styled with CSS. It is still a WIP and I am always looking for ways to improve the site!
Right now I am working on a contact form so you can get in touch with me. For now, my email is available on my LinkedIn which you can find on my card in the Home section. I am also working on making it compatible with mobile so it is more accessible to everyone.
